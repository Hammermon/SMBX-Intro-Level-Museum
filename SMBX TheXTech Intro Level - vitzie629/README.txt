Thank you for downloading my SMB3 themed intro for SMBX which is designed for TheXTech due to the custom hardcoded GFX being
used in there! To use this intro, copy the three files from this folder to the root folder of TheXTech. If you plan to reuse the old intro level
for the future, make a backup for that original intro level. Credits go to Andrew "Redigit" Spinks who originally made the intro for SMBX
1.3, the very last SMBX version that he ever released, & me (vitzie629) for making modifications to the level. Music used in the level is the
overworld music from both Newgrounds flash fangames Bullet Bill 1 & 2 by Psycosis91 (despite the audio quality being lower in Bullet Bill 1,
the audio quality is much higher in Bullet Bill 2), & this is Super Koopa Bros. world 1 music from the game Paper Mario: The 
Thousand-Year Door but sped up & higher pitched. Also, credit goes to Wohlstand for the SMBX 1.0 TheXTech logo used in the nostalgic
X-Tech assets folder & Krissy Silvermoon for "TheXTech" logo under right the word "Bros.".

Enjoy this new TheXTech intro!
