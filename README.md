The content in this pack are almost not entirely mine nor do i claim them as my own. As
a workaround i put the names at the last of the folders so that level belongs to who.
(a idea by Squishy Rex's CGFX Pack)
also, AFAIK, these intros are completely untampered and have been like this since.
For some people who dont know how to import a intro: copy the one you desire, and then
put it on your SMBX 1.3 folder/TheXTech/X2 (IF you use only the vanilla menu which is 
acsesible in versions pre B5) the same folder as in with the smbx.exe. Replace the intro
and it should be good to go.

If you have any intros to suggest to me/ some problems or would like to make some intros for the pack,
message me in PMs in the SMBX Forums, under Hammermon (you probably know at this point)

i should resort to discord soon or make a whole server about intros/outros (once i am of age,
of course)

Also another note, some of the intro levels are unfortunatley not downloadable so
i would have to recreate them as much as the original.

also have a plan to include outros the next update.

thx for reading bye and have fun with
your intros! :3
